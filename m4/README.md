# Homework M4: Jenkins

# Assignment

You are expected to create the following

1. Single virtual machine with Jenkins and Docker installed

2. Jenkins pipeline to build the BGApp application used in M3 and M4. There should be steps for:

- Downloading the project from your remote repository

- Building the images

- Creating a common network

- Running the containers

As usual, try to do the infrastructure part as automated as possible. Of course, using Vagrant. For the Jenkins part, as we did not cover yet the required techniques, create and execute the pipeline manually
