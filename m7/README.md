# Homework M7: Elastic Stack

Main goal is to build further on what was demonstrated during the practice

## Tasks

Utilizing what was discussed and shown during the lecture, try to do the following:

1. Build an infrastructure with three machines - one server for the <strong>Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)</strong> and two clients - one with <strong>CentOS</strong> and one with <strong>Ubuntu</strong>. For the server you can use either <strong>CentOS or Ubuntu</strong>

2. Install <strong>Metricbeat</strong> on the two client machines and make sure that the <strong>system module is enabled</strong>

3. Configure the <strong>Logstash</strong> to receive data from the beats and to forward the data to <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>

4. Using the REST API create an index pattern in Kibana

Please note that your solution should be automated to the extent possible

## Proof

Prepare a document that show what you accomplished and how you did it. It can include (not limited to):

1. The commands you used to achieve the above tasks

2. Any configuration files produced while solving the tasks

3. A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results
